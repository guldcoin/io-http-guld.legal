In this event, all prior contracts will be canceled and the name will be made available for claim in a new registration.\n\n### Section 2: Individual Names\n\nEach Individual Member must register a name and public key in the designated blocktree locations, and pay the one-time individual name registration fee specified in Appendices A and B.\n\nIndividuals may sign and witness contracts with their registered name and key. Such records must be kept in the member's blocktree branch.\n\n### Section 3: Group Names\n\nMembers may form groups by registering a group membership agreement signed by the founding members, and paying the one-time group name registration fee specified in Appendices A and B.\n\nEach group membership agreement must define a vote weighting table, and must maintain a public record of all names and keys of voters.\n\nGroups may sign and witness contracts by obtaining signatures by a majority of weighted votes. Such records must be kept in the group's blocktree branch.\n\n### Section 4: Device Names\n\nIndividuals and groups may register additional names with unique signing keys as \"Devices\".\n\nDevice names must end with `-ai` or `-device`.\n\nDevices are the legal responsibility of their owner.\n\nDevices receive their own namespaces, and ledger accounts, which may be controlled with either that device's signing key or the owner's key.\n\nDevices may sign and witness contracts with their registered name and key. Such records must be kept in the device's blocktree branch.\n\n## Article 2: Core Groups\n\nThis Agreement defines the following groups, which all Members must witness.\n\n### Section 1: Guld group\n\nThis Agreement defines the group with name \"guld\", a Group member subject to Article 1 Section 3.\n\nThe guld group uses ledger-cli files to keep it's vote weighting table, with voting members defined as those having balance in a `guld:Equity` sub-account in their name.\n\nAll paths in this Agreement and all others filed in the blocktree are assumed to be relative to the path `.blocktree/guld`, which is governed by the guld group.\n\nThe guld group stores their vote weighting table and other ledger files in `ledger/GULD`.\n\nThe guld group is a meritocracy, in which only those Members who contribute open source intellectual property will receive `guld:Equity`, always in the form of a grant. All types of contributions will be considered, including but not limited to technology, art, law, and administration. Budget panels will be elected by area of expertise to manage contributions and grants.\n\nAll `guld:Equity` balances are non-transferable.\n\n### Section 2: Peer to Peer Bar group\n\nThis Agreement defines the group with name \"p2p-bar\", a Group member subject to Article 1 Section 3.\n\nThe p2p-bar group uses ledger-cli files to keep it's vote weighting table, with voting members defined as those having balance in a `p2p-bar:Equity` sub-account in their name.\n\nThe p2p-bar group stores their vote weighting table and other ledger files in `ledger/p2p-bar/p2p-bar/equity.dat`.\n\nThe p2p-bar group is an international association of legal professionals also known as a bar association. All members of the p2p-bar group must agree to uphold both their local laws, as well as the contracts they witness on the blocktree.\n\nThe p2p-bar group will review and manage the grant budget for all contributions to the field of law.\n\nAll arbitrators named in witnessed contracts must be registered members of the p2p-bar group.\n\nAll `p2p-bar:Equity` balances are non-transferable.\n\n## Article 3: The Blocktree\n\nThe purpose of this Agreement is to govern the contents of the blocktree, a distributed filesystem.\n\n### Section 1: Root Hash\n\nMembers agree to accept all files and history of the blocktree as is, from the first prototype ledger in June 2016 up to the root hash, which is `23c03194e1b951e5dd4d2d0889de7a551ea83a74`.\n\n### Section 2: Namespaces\n\nEach registered name entitles the member to a corresponding namespace on the blocktree. The member has the right to publish files to their official sub-trees and branches, as enumerated in Appendix D.\n\nEach member takes legal responsibility for the contents of their blocktree branch, and must be able to provide a signed history for each file and witnessed link in their branch upon demand by Arbitrator or other authority agreed to by contract.\n\nEach member may maintain a perspective branch in their name for any other record in the blocktree.\n\n### Section 3: Rights and Restrictions\n\nMembers may encrypt any files that are not otherwise contractually restricted. Any open source encryption tools which are linked in the blocktree `tech` sub-tree may be used.\n\nMembers may publish original content to their own namespace, provided it does not violate the terms of this Agreement or another registered contract.\n\nMembers cannot publish to another Member’s branch without contractually defined right.\n\nMembers may create and govern additional sub-trees within their own, linking such as git sub-modules.\n\nNo Member shall publish or cause to be published to the blocktree a file which is larger than 10 MB. Such files should be shared using torrents, and the torrents should be published to the blocktree.\n\nNo Member shall publish or cause to be published any malicious executables or instructions.\n\nNo Member shall publish or cause to be published anything which would be considered a crime for someone in their local jurisdiction to publish.\n\n### Section 4: Data Retention\n\nEach member must retain all contracts to which Member is a party, as well as all data referenced in the contracts.\n\nEach member must retain source for any files linked in their branch of the blocktree.\n\nMembers agree to keep a copy of the guld ledger, especially any transactions involving the `guld:Equity` account or one of their own accounts.\n\n## Article 4: Contracts\n\nMembers are free to contract with each other, subject to the terms of this Agreement.\n\n### Section 1: Format\n\nParties may be known by their public key and name registered to a group common to all parties, i.e. the guld group.\n\nParties must be able to sign contracts with detached signature blocks.\n\nContract variables must be indicated with underscores followed by a single space and an UPPERCASE_NAME i.e. _______ ARBITRATOR\n\n### Section 2: Registration With Witnesses\n\nA contract is considered valid once witnessed by a third party Member.\n\n### Section 3: Arbitration\n\nAll disputes of or related to the formation, performance, or execution of this Agreement, if not resolved by the parties, shall be submitted to the sole jurisdiction of the p2p-bar group (the ARBITRATOR) and agree to abide by the terms of the award, under the New York Convention on Enforceability.\n\nContracts must define an arbitrator, who must be a registered member of the p2p-bar group, in good standing.\n\nContracts must agree to the terms of the New York Convention on Enforceability on arbitration.\n\nIn the case of a dispute, all data related to the disputed contract must be shared with the contractually defined arbitrator, with proof of their authenticity by witnessed links in the blocktree.\n\n## Article 5: Amendments\n\nAny amendments to this Agreement or documents referenced herein shall be made in writing and signed cryptographically by a majority of `guld:Equity` holders, and published to guld blocktree branches, including the amendments to the writing requirement stated in this provision.\n\n## Appendices\n\n### Appendix A.
